    <p>
        This service was handcrafted with the welfare of every Trinbagonian in mind. 
        From design to implementation we thought about the dynamics that shape the job application process in T&T. 
        With us you're sure that the job listings are 100% legitimate. The MDAs directly add or remove jobs from our servers
        so there's no middle man with false information in order to give you a piece of mind. 
        <br><br>
        Our personal profiles enable you to apply for jobs more quickly. 
        We allow you to save information and use it in applications. CVs, Birth Certificates and other documents do not have to be reuploaded. All data is encrypted and 
        all connections are secured to ensure that privacy remains uncompromised. Stay employed with employTT!
